# MySketchbook V1

Build a simple sketchbook application that saves data to firebase. Users should be able to login and create a new canvas, create a piece of artwork on the canvas and save it to firebase. The application will need a list view of all of their canvases.

Canvas is fun, but it can get really complicated as your application gets more complication. We will be using the Konva library to make it a little easier.
